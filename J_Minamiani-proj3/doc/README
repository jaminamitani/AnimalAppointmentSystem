 You will design the administration program for a veterinary office: 
 The office takes care of Dogs, Birds, and Fish.
 Each having and Owner, name, age, diseases and status of current/past, and list of vaccinations
 Each owners have a name, address, and phone number.

This program allows you to access 
- current appointments on hold,
- list of resolved appointments,
- make unresolved -> resolved
- search funciton by owner name, appointment date, and animals
- add new appointment
- save list
- and load list

I have created a main class that takes charge of all objects: owner, animal(dog, fish, bird), appointments, diseases
and save them as a list of appointments.
Each appointment holds owner, one animal, and all other fields necessary
Each animal then holds a list of disease object.

In main class, there is a display menu and a method for each functionality.

As a conclusion, i learned that error checking is simple but can be very tedious.
